## 10/1/2025 - Researched power system and battery requirements!  

Calculated some of the power stuff, which BMS board I can use and a couple of the things to calculate the overall charging system :). Connecting the Pico will be through a USB Micro B port. The VBUS will connect to the BMS for charging, and BMS to VSYS. This is the Breakout I plan on using, but probably won't expose the USB Port on it!
