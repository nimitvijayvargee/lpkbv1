## 10/1/2025 9:16 AM - Researched power system and battery requirements!  

Calculated some of the power stuff, which BMS board I can use and a couple of the things to calculate the overall charging system :). Connecting the Pico will be through a USB Micro B port. The VBUS will connect to the BMS for charging, and BMS to VSYS. This is the Breakout I plan on using, but probably won't expose the USB Port on it!

## 10/1/2025 9:56 AM - Make KLE Layouts!  

I made some KLE Layouts for Matrix and Label! Matrix is going to be required for Vial later on so I decided to do that right now. I also made the PCB Files and added them to the repo! Gonna start work on the schematic now :D. Also, why are low profile keycaps so expensive, and I don't even have aliexpress ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
